# BookMall
practice project of JavaWeb learning

## Intro
- Followed course https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AS4y177xJ?p=56 and implemented the project in that course on my own computer.

## Features
- implemented a SpringMVC Lite (includes DispatcherServelt, Filters, Listeners, IoC container, Transaction Manager, and JDBC), packaged in myssm0.1.jar
- use Thymeleaf to render the html files.
- use Vue.js, Axios to seperate front end and back end.

## To be improved
- Not all .html files are adjusted by Vue and Axios to totally seperate front end and back end. 
- Major functionalities are implemented, but other minor ones (e.g. limit discounts on books) are to be implemented later on.
